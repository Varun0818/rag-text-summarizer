# 🧠 Text Summarizer using RAG-like Pipeline

This project is a **text summarization tool** that intelligently compresses large documents into concise summaries. It combines **semantic chunk retrieval** using Sentence-BERT and FAISS with **abstractive summarization** powered by BART, following a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) inspired architecture.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Semantic Chunking**: Splits large text into overlapping chunks.
- 🤖 **Embedding & Retrieval**: Uses Sentence-BERT with FAISS for finding relevant chunks.
- ✨ **Abstractive Summarization**: Summarizes the most relevant content using Facebook's BART model.
- ⚡ **GPU Support**: Automatically uses GPU if available for faster performance.
- 🧩 **Modular Codebase**: Easy to customize and extend.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
Text_summarizer/
├── summarizer.py           # Main pipeline script
├── text.txt                # Input text file to be summarized
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
└── README.md               # Project documentation
```

---

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-summarizer-rag.git
cd text-summarizer-rag
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Place your input text in the `text.txt` file.
2. Run the summarizer:

```bash
python summarizer.py
```

3. The script will output a concise summary of the input text.

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can change the following constants in `summarizer.py`:

```python
CHUNK_SIZE = 500             # Size of each text chunk
CHUNK_OVERLAP = 100          # Overlap between chunks
TOP_K = 5                    # Number of top relevant chunks to summarize
MAX_SUMMARY_LENGTH = 512     # Max length of generated summary
MIN_SUMMARY_LENGTH = 150     # Min length of generated summary
```

## 🧠 Models Used

- **Embedding**: [`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- **Summarization**: [`facebook/bart-large-cnn`](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn)

## 📌 To-Do / Ideas for Future

- [ ] Add Streamlit/Gradio UI
- [ ] Enable question-based summarization (true RAG-style QA)
- [ ] Support PDF or DOCX input
- [ ] Improve chunking using token-based NLP
